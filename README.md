2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Build the project using Maven:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run

5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

This project can be used as a starting point for developing web applications with Spring Boot. You can modify the `index.html` file to customize the front-end and add your business logic in the Java files under the `src/main/java` directory.
